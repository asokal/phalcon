						Hello, Phalcon team. I would like to share with you our success story of using Phalcon in <a href="http://kolesa.kz">http://kolesa.kz</a> and <a href="http://krisha.kz">http://krisha.kz</a> projects, the most visited and highloaded sites in Kazakhstan, ranked in TOP-10 classified sites in the CIS. Both sites work on single RESTful-like API written on Phalcon\Mvc\Micro. On peak loads API processes something like 400 req/sec and this is not a limit. Moving to Phalcon allowed us to reduce response generation time and the consumption of CPU and RAM, as well as to reduce the time of development process. We will continue using Phalcon in our new projects. Thank you for the great work you are doing!

						Phalcon Team, The framework you guys have created is amazing. I've never used a framework that has combined speed, efficiency, brevity, and naturality all in one package. I intend on championing and contributing back to the project in any way that I can. I embarked recently on an ~800 hour project and am happy to say that we are using Phalcon Framework. Bravo.
